# SECURITY OPERATIONS
*Security Operations is a critical component in the Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification, as it directly ties into the day-to-day activities of a cybersecurity analyst. It refers to the practices, processes, and tools used to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in an organization. Security Operations ensures that cybersecurity teams can effectively monitor, detect, and respond to incidents, minimizing damage and preventing future risks.*

## [1.1] Explain the importance of system and network architecture concepts in security operations.
### Log ingestion 
  - Time synchronization- 
  - Logging levels

### Operating system (OS) concepts
  - Windows Registry
  - System hardening
  - File structure
    - Configuration file locations
  - System processes
  - Hardware architecture

### Infrastructure concepts
  - Serverless
  - Virtualization
  - Containerization

### Network architecture
  - On-premises
  - Cloud
  - Hybrid
  - Network segmentation
  - Zero trust
  - Secure access secure edge (SASE)
  - Software-defined networking (SDN)

 ### Identity and access management
  - Multifactor authentication (MFA)
  - Single sign-on (SSO)
  - Federation
  - Privileged access management (PAM)
  - Passwordless
  - Cloud access security broker (CASB)

 ### Encryption
  - Public key infrastructure (PKI)
  - Secure sockets layer (SSL) inspection

### Sensitive data protection
  - Data loss prevention (DLP)
  - Personally identifiable information (PII)
  - Cardholder data (CHD)

## [1.2] Given a scenario, analyze indicators of potentially malicious activity.
### Network-related
  - Bandwidth consumption
  - Beaconing
  - Irregular peer-to-peer communication
  - Rogue devices on the network
  - Scans/sweeps
  - Unusual traffic spikes
  - Activity on unexpected ports

### Host-related
  - Processor consumption
  - Memory consumption
  - Drive capacity consumption
  - Unauthorized software
  - Malicious processes
  - Unauthorized changes
  - Unauthorized privileges
  - Data exfiltration
  - Abnormal OS process behavior
  - File system changes or anomalies
  - Registry changes or anomalies
  - Unauthorized scheduled tasks

### Application-related
  - Anomalous activity
  - Introduction of new accounts
  - Unexpected output
  - Unexpected outbound communication
  - Service interruption
  - Application logs

### Other
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Obfuscated Links 

## [1.3] Given a scenario, use appropriate tools or techniques to determine malicious activity.

## [1.4] Compare and contrast threat-intelligence and threat-hunting concepts.

## [1.5] Explain the importance of efficiency and process improvement in security operations.
