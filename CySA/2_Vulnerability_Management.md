# VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
*Vulnerability management is essential in CySA for identifying and addressing weaknesses in systems before attackers can exploit them. It reduces the attack surface and helps prevent breaches. Additionally, it ensures regulatory compliance by meeting industry standards like HIPAA or PCI-DSS. Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their risk helps optimize resources and focus on the most critical threats. By integrating with threat intelligence, vulnerability management enhances proactive defense against emerging risks. Ultimately, it strengthens an organizationâ€™s overall cybersecurity posture, ensuring continuous improvement and reducing exposure to potential cyberattacks.*
