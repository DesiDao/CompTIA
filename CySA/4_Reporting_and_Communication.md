# REPORTING AND COMMUNICATION
*Reporting and Communication in CySA is vital for ensuring clear, accurate, and timely dissemination of security incident details. It enables stakeholders, including management and relevant teams, to understand the impact, response actions, and ongoing risks. Effective reporting ensures proper documentation for compliance, audits, and future analysis. Transparent communication fosters coordination across departments, enhances decision-making, and helps in managing external communications, such as with law enforcement or regulatory bodies. This process is essential for maintaining trust and ensuring a well-coordinated, effective response to cybersecurity threats.*
